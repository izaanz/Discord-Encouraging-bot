# Discord-Encouraging-bot

A discord encouragement bot built with Python that:

1. Inspires user with a random quote (use !inspire command to trigger)
2. Encourages user whenever a sad word is detected
3. Allows user to add custom encouraging words to the database (!new word here)
4. Allows user to delete custom-added words (!del index)
5. Lists the user added words along with index (!list)
6. Ability to turn on/off the function to respond whenever a sad word is detected (!respond true) or (!respond false)
7. !hello to say hello to bot, !bye to say goodbye to bot.

The script of the bot is inspired by Beau.

To use the bot on your server, get the bot key from discord/developers page and paste in the .env file.

For random quotes i am using API from quotesnewtab.com
